# Step-by-step guide to DCM for fMRI and PEB
This step-by-step guide accompanies a pair of tutorial papers on group effective connectivity analysis, published in NeuroImage (see links below). The guide walks through a DCM for fMRI analysis and testing hypotheses at the group level using PEB. 

## The papers
You may wish to start with the theory papers, which explain how each step in the analysis works:
